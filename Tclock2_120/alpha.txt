Tclock2 v1.2.0

This text file will document all the items in Tclock2 that either don't work or don't work completely. 

	
Hidden Rebar Grippers:
----------------------------
Currently this only hides the grippers, they are still there just they're colors have been changed to match the rebar. As 		soon as I get it working correctly, you will be able to completely romove the grippers.

	
Start Button Skinning:
-------------------------
This works fine unless you either unload and reload Tclock2 several times(20+) or change the system colors alot(20+). A 	simple refresh fixes this for now, I am working on a Fix for this.

	
Clock Skinning:
------------------
Currently you are only able to stretch the skin, not a big deal will fix soon.
	

Calender:
-----------
Tclock2 has its own built-in calender. As of right now, it cannot be customized. This will change soon!
